# tinygame 5 - One Page You

2 Days ago - 21.12.23 - I tried a solo RPG for the first time
ever - [Wasted Hours](https://rommelkot.itch.io/wasted-hours).
The same night, I played [ONE PAGE LEFT](https://mkirin.itch.io/one-page-left).

**[ONE PAGE LEFT](https://mkirin.itch.io/one-page-left) blew me away**. The ruleset is so simple but gives so much room
for
creativity and imagination.  
The next day I thought a lot about the concept of [ONE PAGE LEFT](https://mkirin.itch.io/one-page-left)... and wondered
if it would work for different scenarios.

The same day - yesterday, 22.12.23 - I tried the holiday version of One Page
left: [ONE PAGE HOLIDAY](https://mkirin.itch.io/one-page-holiday) - it's
awesome([go buy it](https://mkirin.itch.io/one-page-holiday))!

While laying in bed, I thought about other scenarios... and after waking up, I started writing down some ideas.

## ChatGPT changed a lot

Over the day I talked a lot with ChatGPT about some concepts. **I think ChatGPT really helps me to not overthink things
quietly in my head for days.**  
When brainstorming, often the quality of the ideas are not that important - any form of somewhat appropriate feedback is
enough to keep the flow going. That's why I use ChatGPT so much lately - especially for exploring completely new ideas
like game development.

## ups, maybe its more then just coding "a game"

The last 2-3 weeks I fell down into the [itch.io](https://itch.io/) rabbit hole and (re-)discovered(?) the wonderful
world of out-of-the-box thinking and endless creativity.  
**I also might re-discovered the connection between creativity, art, emotions and identity... why I once was deeply in
love in (creating) art and why exploring the idea for this game is way more than just a _game development_.**

The following is a rough draft of the game concept. It is heavily inspired
by [ONE PAGE LEFT](https://mkirin.itch.io/one-page-left) and [ONE PAGE HOLIDAY](https://mkirin.itch.io/one-page-holiday)
and I do use it as a base for exploring my idea of a different version.   
It's currently in a super rough state and is basically just a dump of ideas, notes lots snippets from conversations with
ChatGPT.

My version is called **ONE PAGE YOU** and is about putting yourself into a situation or adventure and explore it by
writing and drawing.

Since this isn't a blog, the following draft will change a lot over time. So keep that in mind in case it doesn't make
sense:D.

# The Game: ONE PAGE YOU

ONE PAGE YOU is a solo role-playing game about putting yourself into different situations and adventures. Your character
will experience an adventure it
never imaged before.
This is a positive game and cozy game, the only outcome is that you will have a good time.

In order to play this game you will need
the following:

- a six-sided die (d6)
- at least 3 different colored pens or pencils
- a colored marker
- a sheet of paper (letter/a4)

Playtime is between 30 minutes to an hour. Expect chaos and disorganization.
This is a cozy game, so make yourself a cup of tea and get comfortable - or, open the window and let the fresh air in -
whatever fits the scenario you are about to get thrown into<3

You begin ONE PAGE YOU by creating a character and
then a situation or adventure to explore. brace yourself for an adventure! Do the numbered steps
in order…

## 1. YOUR LUCKY NUMBER.

[This is the original text from One Page Left. I'll replace it with a different concept.]

Pick a number between 1 and 6.
Write it out as a word in the middle of the page, then draw a
rectangle around it. This is your lucky number. From now on,
whenever you roll the die and the result is your lucky number
you must draw one symbol of Luck on the page. This symbol
can be anything; a heart, a smiley face, a four-leaf clover, etc.
Decide what your Luck will look like, then draw 1 Luck.

## 2. YOUR CHARACTER.

Create your character by rolling the die twice and reviewing the table to the right. The first roll decides
the top category (the one with the black background) while
the second roll decides the sub-category beneath it.

## 5. WAKING UP in the morning

Do the following steps in order:

1. Imagine yourself on the morning of a beautiful day.
   At the top of the page, introduce your character the same way you would do in a diary entry in the morning of the day
   your adventure begins.
2. Draw the two items from your inventory in the middle of the page
3. Start your adventure by writing "lets go!" under the diary entry and rolling the dice.

## 6. THE ADVENTURE.

note: this may be should be moved before "5. WAKING UP" to don't kill the flow after "writing "lets go!""

From now on, repeat the next two steps in order:

1. Roll the die. You may draw an X on one Luck to increase/decrease the value of the number rolled by 1. Either way,
   record the final
   number on the margins of the page.
2. Using the table below, do the prompt with the number you rolled, starting at the top and working your way down (
   example: if you
   rolled 1 for the first time you would do the prompt labeled [1], the second time you roll 1 you would do prompt [11],
   and so on)
   Remember: If you roll your lucky number, draw 1 Luck.

### Rule: DON’T RUN OUT OF LUCK OR SPACE.

note: this should be incorporated into the game-loop or something to not have it sit there after explaining the main
game-loop. The game should start after that.
