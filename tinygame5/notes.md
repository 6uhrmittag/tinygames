# notes

- the player should always be able to dodge an action or wist it to their advantage to avoid any triggering or
  uncomfortable situations
- the game is played on a single sheet of paper
- the goal is to fill in the paper with words or drawings in different colors
- the game should encourage the player to think outside the box and express themselves in a creative way

## Game preparation:

- character creation
- inventory creation
- choice of overall situation or adventure

## Game loop:

1. roll dice
2. choose action from table
3. write or draw the described action on the paper

The games end then the paper is full or the action says so.

## Game modes

For variety there are two additional modes available::
[HARD MODE] Increase the challenge by
playing using a smaller sheet of paper,
such as an index card.
[DIGITAL MODE] Players wanting to play
using a drawing tablet can do so under
one condition: they must use the same
brush size for the entire game.

## Customization

The game can be customized by adding character traits and inventory items to the tables.
Do this before starting the game.

## Inventory

- Items could range from magical objects to everyday items with sentimental value.
- a "Cloak of Many Colors" that allows the character to blend into any environment.
- a speaking dog
- a babelfish that allows the character to understand any language

## Scenarios

- "Mystical Journey," "Everyday Life," "Historical Quest," etc.
- "Lost in a Fairytale" or "CEO for a Day,"

## alternatives to overdrawn rule

- Reflective Reshaping: When the page is full, the player takes a moment to review their journey, then selects areas
  to "evolve." They can overlay new drawings or text, symbolizing growth or change, effectively layering their
  experience like a palimpsest.
- Rethink the space on the page as a resource that changes the game's dynamics as it becomes scarce but doesn't end the
  game.
- Condensing Core: As the space becomes limited, the prompts encourage the player to focus on the core of their
  character's journey or distill their adventure into powerful symbols or keywords. It becomes a challenge of
  expression, encouraging more profound or more abstract reflection as space runs out.
- Instead of space, consider other aspects of the game that could naturally lead to a conclusion.
- Narrative Milestones: The game could conclude after a certain number of narrative milestones are reached,
- "Your objective is to creatively and successfully navigate through the main and side scenarios, using the space on
  your page wisely. Fill the page with your journey's drawings and writings, balancing between expressing your adventure
  fully and managing the available space. Consider your game complete when you feel satisfied with your exploration of
  the scenarios and when the page is fully utilized."
    - Define "Successful Experience": It might be helpful to provide players with guidance on what constitutes a "
      successful" navigation of scenarios.
    - Encourage Reflective Space Management: Encourage players to think of the page not just as a physical space but as
      a representation of their journey's timeline or emotional landscape. This approach can make the act of space
      management more meaningful, as players decide what moments deserve more space and which can be smaller, symbolic
      representations.
        - -> maybe add some "reflection" actions? (take a short break. reflect the journey so far.)

## alternatives to the luck mechanic

- Inspiration Mechanic: Concept: Players have a set of "Inspiration Points" (or a similar positive term like "Spark", "
  Muse", "Spirit", etc.) that represent their character's creative energy, motivation, or personal strength. Rather than
  forcing an end to the game, running out of Inspiration Points prompts a moment of reflection, adjustment, or growth.
- Instead of marking off a point as a loss, encourage them to describe or draw how they overcome this challenge, using
  it as a moment of growth or learning. -> interesting!
